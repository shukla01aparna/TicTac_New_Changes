# TicTac_New_Changes

Functions:
It's a TicTacToe game where clicking the squares will display either the X or O. At the end it will declare either the winner or draw.

New Changes:
Intially a player can click on the same square as many time. So made a change that player can't select the square if it's already selected.
Added a button to start a new game at the end.
